### DS241: Intro to Data Science
The following archives are a collection of the representative coding work elaborated since the beggining of the semester. 

It's mainly based on the programming language "R", which is mainly used for data tidying and analysis. 

#### Some of the main skills demonstrated in the following portfolio are:

-Visualizing data using ggplot2 (scatterplot, histogram, barchart, lineplot).

-Manipulate data (demonstrate dplyr verbs, filter, summarise, join, select, rename, slice).

-Data loading, tidying and cleaning.

-Data science processes
