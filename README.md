### DS241: Data Science
The following archives are a collection of the representative coding work elaborated since the beggining of the semester. 

It's mainly based on the programming language "R", which is mainly used for data tidying and analysis. 

Some of the work done in the repository includes NYC flight analysis, enrollment predictions, DC bikeshare examination for future decision-making, restaurant/hotel territorial calculations, etc.

#### The main skills demonstrated in the following portfolio are:

-Visualizing data using ggplot2 (scatterplot, histogram, barchart, lineplot).

-Manipulate data (demonstrate dplyr verbs, filter, summarise, join, select, rename, slice).

-Data loading, tidying and cleaning.

-Data science processes
